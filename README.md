## Cars Purchase Amount
This project aims to sort out cars purchase amounts. The model will be trained on the dataset of Car Purchasing Data with the data about Customers Name, Customers e-mail, Country, Gender,	Age, Annual Salary,	Credit Card Debt,	Net Worth, and finally the Car Purchase Amount. 

## Data
The data for this project is a collection of the customers information and the amount of the car that's purchased. Further, the data will be splitted into "train" and "test" sets.

## Model
The model in this project is developed using deep learning optimizers in tensorflow. Additionally, we implemented GridSearchCV technique from scikit-learn library to improve the performance of our models. 

## Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as r2_score(R squared), rmse(root mean squared error), mse(mean squared error).
